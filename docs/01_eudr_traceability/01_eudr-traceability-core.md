# EUDR Traceability Core Offer

**Partners:** Komba GIS AB with OpenForests, Mergin Maps, and trusted field auditors.

---

## Objective

Help commodity buyers and forest managers comply with Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 by delivering defensible, geospatially verified traceability evidence and risk assessments that align with EUDR due diligence submissions.

---

## Methodology

1. **Traceability Baseline** - Clean and validate supplier geolocation data (boundaries, polygons, certificates) into a harmonised PostGIS/GeoPackage database.
2. **Deforestation Screening** - Analyse multi-temporal radar and optical imagery (Sentinel-1/2, NICFI, Hansen, RADD) to flag post-2020 forest loss and degradation.
3. **Contextual Risk Overlay** - Combine loss alerts with land-use designations, protected areas, slope, accessibility, and governance indices to rate risk (Low / Medium / High).
4. **Verification Pathway** - Design site visits, drone surveys, or partner-led forestry inspections for ambiguous or high-risk suppliers.
5. **Reporting & Submission** - Deliver datasets, maps, and evidence packages aligned with the EU's forthcoming EUDR Information System, plus guidance for internal controls.
