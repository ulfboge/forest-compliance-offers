# Forest Compliance Assurance Platform – Partner Teaser

## Why

- **Pressure points:** EUDR compliance, certification readiness, investor due diligence.
- **Gap:** Clients struggle to connect spatial traceability, on-the-ground monitoring, and finance narratives into one engagement.
- **Opportunity:** Offer a modular partner stack (Komba GIS AB + OpenForests + Mergin Maps + financial/certification experts) that scales from traceability to investment verification.

## Modular Offer (Stackable Blocks)

| Module | Purpose | Lead/Partners | Typical Duration* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EUDR Traceability Core** | Collect & verify supply geolocation, screen for post-2020 forest loss, produce due-diligence evidence. | Komba GIS AB, OpenForests, field auditors | 6–10 weeks |
| **Certification Pre-Audit** | FSC/PEFC/carbon readiness screen, gap analysis, corrective roadmap. | Komba GIS AB + certification partners | 8–12 weeks |
| **Enhanced Monitoring** | Ongoing satellite/drone/telemetry alerting tied to corrective actions. | Komba GIS AB, drone teams, telemetry integrators | 10–14 weeks setup |
| **Operational & Financial Readiness** | Excel-first valuation, capex/opex roadmap, investor deck with compliance linkage. | Komba GIS AB + finance advisors (Giuseppe) | 8–12 weeks |

> *Durations vary with geography and portfolio size. Modules can run sequentially or in parallel.

## Teaser Narrative (slide or email)

1. **Problem Statement (Slide 1)**  
   - Clients must prove deforestation-free supply, maintain certification standing, and convince lenders—all with fragmented data.  
   - Current tooling misses cross-module integration.

2. **Solution Snapshot (Slide 2)**  
   - Introduce the Forest Compliance Assurance Platform: Komba GIS AB + partners delivering EUDR traceability, certification readiness, monitoring, and finance packaging.  
   - Highlight modular approach: start with traceability, add certification or finance modules as needed.

3. **How It Works (Slide 3)**  
   - Simple workflow graphic: *Traceability Baseline → Certification & Monitoring → Financial Readiness → Investment Verification*.  
   - Mention shared data backbone (PostGIS/GIS workspaces, Excel templates, partner dashboards).

4. **Value Proposition (Slide 4)**  
   - For clients: de-risk EUDR submissions, shorten certification cycles, unlock financing.  
   - For partners like Alex: consistent pipeline of geospatial deliverables that can absorb his drone/monitoring services.

5. **Call to Action (Slide 5)**  
   - Co-develop a pilot (e.g., target cooperative or timber concession) to package traceability + pre-audit + monitoring lite.  
   - Invite Alex to join a workshop to scope roles, deliverables, and revenue share.

## Talking Points for Alex

- Lean in with the monitoring module: emphasise how his drone capabilities slot into the integrated pipeline.
- Stress that the platform is modular—initial engagement can be lightweight (traceability + teaser monitoring) with room to scale.
- Share approximate timeline bands and clarify that detail-level proposals can follow once the teaser lands.

## Next Steps

1. Convert this outline into a 5-slide deck (PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva).  
2. Include a visuals slide using assets from `docs/06_visuals/`.  
3. Reference the detailed Markdown modules only if Alex/partners request deeper scope notes.
