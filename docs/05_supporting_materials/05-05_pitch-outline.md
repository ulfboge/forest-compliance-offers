# Forest Compliance Assurance Platform – Partner Teaser

## Why

- **Pressure points:** Clients must prove deforestation-free supply, stay audit-ready across standards, and justify investments to lenders.
- **Gap:** Operational audits and financial narratives are often treated separately, leaving supply chains exposed.
- **Opportunity:** Introduce Komba GIS AB’s dual-pillar platform so OpenForests can refer clients needing integrated operational + financial compliance support—without taking on delivery work.

## The Two Pillars

| Pillar | Focus | Example Outputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operations Audit Services** | Traceability verification, compliance risk screening, continuous monitoring, capacity building | Risk ledgers, monitoring playbooks, SOP packs |
| **Financial Assessment Services** | Cost-benefit modelling, supplier value assessments, investor communications, risk mitigation scenarios | Valuation workbooks, financial scorecards, ESG briefs |

*Both pillars are client-tailored, Excel/GIS friendly, and handed over with training so teams remain self-sufficient.*

## Slide-by-Slide Teaser

1. **Problem Statement** – Fragmented tools make it hard to satisfy EUDR, certification, and investor expectations.
2. **Solution Snapshot** – The Forest Compliance Assurance Platform: operations + finance under one roof, with modular engagement.
3. **Integrated Approach** – Show how field verification feeds financial models (and vice versa) to strengthen supply-chain viability.
4. **Value to OpenForests** – Easy referral path; their partners retain their existing services (Globhe, Nadar, etc.), and we plug the integration gap.
5. **Engagement Process** – Discovery → Scoping → Delivery → Support, highlighting training and tech transfer at every step.

## Talking Points for Alex

- We’re seeking visibility and referrals; OpenForests doesn’t need to co-deliver.
- Highlight that the two pillars can start small (traceability check + ROI snapshot) and expand as needed.
- Reinforce compatibility with existing partner ecosystem—Globhe, Nadar, Varda, etc. remain part of the toolkit.
- Emphasise supply-chain benefits: better-managed suppliers, clearer ROI, more resilient compliance posture.

## Call to Action

1. Feature the platform in explorer.land partner spotlights or resource lists.  
2. Flag us when project managers discuss EUDR readiness, integrated monitoring, or investor-grade reporting.  
3. Arrange a short briefing so the team can confidently recommend us to clients.
