# Forest Compliance Assurance Platform – Partner Teaser

## Why

- **Pressure points:** EUDR compliance, certification readiness, investor due diligence.
- **Gap:** Clients struggle to connect spatial traceability, on-the-ground monitoring, and finance narratives into one engagement.
- **Opportunity:** Position Komba GIS AB’s modular assurance platform so OpenForests project managers can refer interested clients without needing to co-deliver services.

## Modular Offer (Stackable Blocks)

| Module | Purpose | Delivered By | Typical Duration* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EUDR Traceability Core** | Collect & verify supply geolocation, screen for post-2020 forest loss, produce due-diligence evidence. | Komba GIS AB | 6-10 weeks |
| **Certification Pre-Audit** | FSC/PEFC/carbon readiness screen, gap analysis, corrective roadmap (initial readiness only for carbon). | Komba GIS AB (accredited auditors engaged only on request) | 8-12 weeks |
| **Enhanced Monitoring** | Ongoing satellite/drone/telemetry alerting tied to corrective actions. | Komba GIS AB (compatible with Globhe or other providers if client already uses them) | 10-14 weeks setup |
| **Operational & Financial Readiness** | Excel-first valuation, capex/opex roadmap, investor deck with compliance linkage. | Komba GIS AB | 8-12 weeks |

> *Durations vary with geography and portfolio size. Modules can run sequentially or in parallel.

## Teaser Narrative (slide or email)

1. **Problem Statement (Slide 1)**  
   - Clients must prove deforestation-free supply, maintain certification standing, and convince lenders—all with fragmented data.  
   - Current tooling misses cross-module integration.

2. **Solution Snapshot (Slide 2)**  
   - Introduce the Forest Compliance Assurance Platform: a modular offer from Komba GIS AB covering traceability, certification readiness, monitoring, and finance packaging.  
   - Highlight modular approach: start with traceability, add certification or finance modules as needed.

3. **How It Works (Slide 3)**  
   - Simple workflow graphic: *Traceability Baseline → Certification & Monitoring → Financial Readiness → Investment Verification*.  
   - Mention shared data backbone (PostGIS/GIS workspaces, Excel templates, partner dashboards).

4. **Value Proposition (Slide 4)**  
   - For clients: de-risk EUDR submissions, shorten certification cycles, unlock financing.  
   - For OpenForests & Alex: easy referral option when clients ask for deeper compliance support; no delivery burden, but a pathway to extend value and demonstrate ecosystem breadth.

5. **Call to Action (Slide 5)**  
   - Feature Komba GIS AB in relevant explorer.land partner spotlights or resource lists.  
   - Encourage OpenForests PMs to flag us when clients ask about EUDR/certification/finance services.  
   - Offer a light briefing call so the team can make confident referrals.

## Talking Points for Alex

- Emphasise that we’re asking for visibility and referrals, not delivery commitments.
- Stress that the platform is modular—initial engagement can be lightweight (traceability + teaser monitoring) with room to scale.
- Share approximate timeline bands and clarify that detail-level proposals can follow once the teaser lands.
- Mention compatibility with the OpenForests partner ecosystem (see `05-06_partner-alignment-matrix.md`) so he knows clients using Globhe, Nadar, etc., can still leverage our services.

## Next Steps

1. Convert this outline into a 5-slide deck (PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva).  
2. Include a visuals slide using assets from `docs/06_visuals/`.  
3. Reference the detailed Markdown modules only if Alex/partners request deeper scope notes.
4. Add a referral slide highlighting how OpenForests can point interested clients to us.
