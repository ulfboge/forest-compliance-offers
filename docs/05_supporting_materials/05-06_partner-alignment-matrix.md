# OpenForests Partner Alignment Matrix (Teaser Support)

| Partner | Core Offering | How We Integrate Them | What They Don’t Cover (Our Added Value) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Globhe** | Global drone data capture for digital twins & AI analytics. | Task Globhe for high-resolution imagery in our Enhanced Monitoring module; feed outputs into deforestation verification, corrective-action tracking, and valuation updates. | They deliver imagery/data only—no compliance packaging, SOP governance, or investor-facing deliverables. |
| **Nadar** | Satellite & AI ecosystem insights (deforestation, carbon, biodiversity). | Plug Nadar’s alerts into our EUDR Traceability Core and monitoring dashboards to enrich risk scoring and remediation plans. | They don’t manage due diligence submissions, cross-standard gap analysis, or financial storytelling. |
| **Biometrio** | Advanced biodiversity analytics. | Use their ecological indicators in Certification Pre-Audit to evidence HCV areas and restoration gains. | No traceability, land-use compliance, or financing integration. |
| **Varda** | Field ID technology for supply-chain traceability. | Align our QGIS/Mergin workflows with Varda IDs to speed onboarding and maintain ID consistency across partners. | They issue IDs but don’t provide spatial analysis or development of compliance toolkits. |
| **ReWild** | Storytelling (film/photography) for restoration projects. | Embed media into monitoring dashboards and investor decks; leverage for communication components of Certification/Financial deliverables. | No analytics, compliance processes, or monitoring governance—purely narrative support. |

## Key Messages for the Teaser

- OpenForests already has strong point-solution partners; we package them into a coherent Forest Compliance Assurance Platform.
- Our differentiator: orchestrating traceability, certification readiness, monitoring, and finance narratives—turning partner data into audit-ready, investor-ready outputs.
- When pitching to Alex, highlight how Globhe’s drone services become a cornerstone of the monitoring module, with us handling compliance integration, documentation, and financial linkage.
