# OpenForests Partner Alignment Matrix (Teaser Support)

| Partner | Core Offering | How Clients Can Combine Them With Us | What They Don’t Cover (Our Added Value) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Globhe** | Global drone data capture for digital twins & AI analytics. | If a client already hires Globhe, we ingest their imagery into Enhanced Monitoring for compliance evidence and KPI tracking—OpenForests simply makes the intro. | They deliver imagery/data only—no compliance packaging, SOP governance, or investor-facing deliverables. Komba GIS AB does not operate drones. |
| **Nadar** | Satellite & AI ecosystem insights (deforestation, carbon, biodiversity). | Clients using Nadar alerts can feed them into our EUDR Traceability Core and dashboards for risk scoring and action planning. | They don’t manage due diligence submissions, cross-standard gap analysis, or financial storytelling. |
| **Biometrio** | Advanced biodiversity analytics. | Their biodiversity indicators slot into our Certification Pre-Audit outputs when clients request ecological evidence. | No traceability, land-use compliance, or financing integration. |
| **Varda** | Field ID technology for supply-chain traceability. | We map Varda field IDs into our QGIS/Mergin workflows to streamline onboarding for clients already on the platform. | They issue IDs but don’t provide spatial analysis or development of compliance toolkits. |
| **ReWild** | Storytelling (film/photography) for restoration projects. | We can reference ReWild content inside reports or dashboards so clients get richer narratives alongside compliance outputs. | No analytics, compliance processes, or monitoring governance—purely narrative support. |

## Key Messages for the Teaser

- OpenForests already has strong point-solution partners; we show clients how our platform complements those services without adding work for the OpenForests team.
- Our differentiator: orchestrating traceability, certification readiness, monitoring, and finance narratives—turning partner data into audit-ready, investor-ready outputs.
- When pitching to Alex, emphasise that referrals are low-effort: if a client already uses Globhe, Nadar, etc., we take it from there and keep them in the loop as needed.
