## Elevator Pitch

Komba GIS AB’s Forest Compliance Assurance Platform combines **Operations Audit Services** and **Financial Assessment Services** so restoration teams can prove deforestation-free origin, stay certification-ready, and communicate investment-grade outcomes. Everything is delivered with built-in training and technology transfer, keeping partners in control while strengthening supply-chain traceability and performance.

## Operations Audit Services

- **Traceability Verification:** Geo-referencing, field verification, and document audits across EUDR, FSC, and related standards.  
- **Compliance Risk Assessment:** Multi-standard risk screening that pinpoints operational vulnerabilities for clients and their suppliers.  
- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous oversight using satellite alerts, partner drone imagery, and field telemetry to ensure compliance doesn’t slip between audits.  
- **Capacity Building:** Workshops, SOPs, and coaching so client teams can sustain the operational framework independently.

*Outcome:* Clients gain a clear, repeatable operational picture that keeps supply chains compliant and improves their long-term viability.

## Financial Assessment Services

- **Cost-Benefit & ROI Analysis:** Quantify compliance investments versus market access, risk mitigation, and opportunity costs.  
- **Supply-Chain Value Assessment:** Supplier scorecards, stability rankings, and benchmarking to understand business-critical dependencies.  
- **Investment-Grade Reporting:** Translate compliance data into investor briefs, ESG metrics, and financing decks.  
- **Financial Risk Mitigation:** Scenario planning and contingency modelling for EUDR/FSC challenges, ready for auditors and financiers.

*Outcome:* Compliance work feeds directly into investment-grade narratives and financial decision-making.

## Integrated Approach

Our operations and finance pillars run side-by-side:

| Operations Focus | Finance Focus | Combined Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Traceability assessments | Cost-benefit models | Evidence-backed ROI for compliance investments |
| Field/telemetry verification | Supplier performance analysis | Stronger, more resilient supply chains |
| SOPs & training | Investor communications | Clients stay in control while engaging partners confidently |

We design engagements so outputs from one pillar reinforce the other—maps, ledgers, and monitoring feeds directly inform valuation workbooks and investor-ready documentation.

## Engagement Process

1. **Discovery:** 1-hour intake to map operational and financial needs along the supply chain.  
2. **Scoping:** Tailor the mix of operations and finance modules, timelines, and training plans.  
3. **Delivery:** Iterative build with combined audits, analytics, and financial modelling.  
4. **Support:** Knowledge transfer, SOP handover, and optional light-touch support to keep systems running.
