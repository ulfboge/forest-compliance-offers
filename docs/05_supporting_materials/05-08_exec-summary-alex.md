## Elevator Pitch

Komba GIS AB helps restoration and forest supply-chain teams turn scattered spatial, field, and financial data into actionable EUDR readiness packages. We deliver modular, client-tailored solutions—backed by hands-on training—so partners stay in control while meeting compliance, certification, and investor expectations.

---

## What Makes Us Different

- **Flexible Modules:** Combine EUDR traceability, certification pre-audit readiness, monitoring analytics, and financial roadmapping as needed. Each engagement is scoped around the client’s existing data, partners, and priorities.
- **Custom Tooling (not black boxes):** Excel-first models, open geospatial workflows, and lightweight dashboards tailored to each cooperative or project—easy to maintain after handover.
- **Training & Tech Transfer:** Every engagement includes structured workshops, SOPs, and coaching so client teams (or partner PMs) can run, audit, and extend the workflows themselves.
- **Integration, Not Overlap:** We complement OpenForests’ ecosystem—ingesting outputs from Globhe, Nadar, Varda, Biometrio, etc., to create audit-ready and investor-ready deliverables without duplicating their services.

## Modular Service Pathway

| Phase | Client Questions | Our Contribution | Typical Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Traceability Baseline** | “Are our suppliers EUDR compliant?” | Clean geodata, risk screening, due-diligence evidence packs | GeoPackage/Excel summary, risk ledger, submission annex |
| **2. Readiness & Training** | “How do we pass audits and own the process?” | Gap analysis, corrective roadmaps, hands-on workshops | Training playbook, SOP bundle, certification brief |
| **3. Monitoring Integration** | “Can we track changes continuously?” | Alert configuration (satellite/telemetry), ingestion of partner drone imagery | Monitoring workbook, KPI dashboards, escalation matrix |
| **4. Financial Translation** | “What does this mean for budgets and investors?” | Scenario modelling, cash-flow outputs, investor memos | Excel valuation models, financing briefs, impact snapshots |

Each phase can stand alone or stack; we scope timelines and budgets according to project size. We never require clients to adopt proprietary software or long-term managed services unless they explicitly request it.
