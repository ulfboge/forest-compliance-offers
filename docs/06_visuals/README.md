# Visual Asset Guidance

Add maps, charts, or other figures here once they are tailored for a specific engagement. Suggested approach:

- Export visuals at print-friendly resolution (300 dpi for PDFs, 150 dpi for slide decks).
- Include a short note in the deliverable or repository history describing data sources and processing steps.
- Remove obsolete assets when new iterations are available so collaborators reference the latest material.

## Subfolders

- `flows/operations_financial_flowchart.md` – Mermaid definition for the dual-pillar service flowchart; paste into any Mermaid renderer (e.g., mermaid.live) to generate the graphic.
