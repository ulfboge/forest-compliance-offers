Next Steps
----------

- Validate priority segments (market size, existing relationships, regulatory pressure).
- Tailor value propositions per segment using operations/financial deliverables.
- Identify prospects for pilot engagements that showcase both audit pillars.

Segment Prioritization Scoring
------------------------------

Scoring rubric (1 = low, 5 = high):

- Market Size captures revenue potential and repeatability of engagements.
- Regulatory Urgency reflects pressure to demonstrate EUDR/NDPE compliance within the next 12–18 months.
- Relationship Access gauges existing networks, geographic fit, or realistic near-term entry.

| Segment | Market Size | Regulatory Urgency | Relationship Access | Total | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------|-------|
| Forest-risk corporates (FMCG, retail) | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 | Large budgets, public EUDR pledges, Nordic/EU presence eases entry but requires senior sponsorship. |
| Commodity traders & processors | 4 | 5 | 2 | 11 | High exposure in Brazil/SEA; strong compliance pressure but access depends on landing a strategic intro or partner. |
| Industrial buyers of forest products | 3 | 4 | 3 | 10 | Mid-sized ticket per engagement; rubber/wood buyers under new EUDR scope with manageable outreach via industry platforms. |
| Banks & lenders | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 | Financing mandates expanding, yet procurement cycles slower; need case studies to pass ESG committees. |
| Certification bodies / NGOs | 2 | 3 | 4 | 9 | Lower direct revenue but high leverage for referrals and credibility; alignment with existing partnerships is key. |
| Institutional investors | 3 | 3 | 3 | 9 | Portfolio analytics demand rising, but pilot scope must be tightly defined to convert interest into paid work. |

Priority Recommendation
-----------------------

- **Immediate focus:** Forest-risk corporates (Tier 1) and commodity traders/processors (Tier 1B) — pursue discovery calls leveraging EUDR deadlines and offer combined operations/finance pilots.
- **Next wave:** Industrial buyers and banks (Tier 2) — prepare tailored one-pagers and identify conferences/industry groups for introductions.
- **Enablement:** Certification bodies/NGOs and institutional investors (Tier 3) — cultivate partnerships that can unlock referrals and proof points for Tier 1 outreach.
