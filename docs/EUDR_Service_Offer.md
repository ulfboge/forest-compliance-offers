 # 🌿 EUDR Compliance & Forest Traceability Services

 **Service Offering – Komba GIS AB (in partnership with OpenForests / Mergin Maps)**

 ---

 ## 1. Objective

 Support companies in meeting EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR, Reg. (EU) 2023/1115) requirements by providing:

 - **Full spatial traceability** of commodity origin
 - **Evidence-based risk assessment** using satellite data and forest monitoring
 - **Expert forestry interpretation** and reporting aligned with EU due diligence workflows

 ## 2. Service Components

 | Component | Description | Core Deliverables | Lead Expertise |
 | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
 | **1. Geolocation & Traceability Mapping** | Collect, verify, and manage farm, plot, or concession boundaries for all commodity suppliers. | Cleaned & validated geospatial database (GeoPackage / PostGIS); coordinate verification maps; traceability summary report | GIS / Remote Sensing |
 | **2. Deforestation Screening (Post-2020)** | Detect forest loss or degradation since 31 Dec 2020 using optical and radar imagery. | Forest loss / degradation maps (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Hansen GFC, RADD); risk flagging per polygon (Low / Medium / High); automation scripts (QGIS, GEE) | Remote Sensing |
 | **3. Land-Use Consistency Check** | Evaluate whether supplier plots align with known land-use designations and protected-area boundaries. | Overlays with land-use zones & protected areas; spatial consistency summary; maps for audit evidence | GIS / Remote Sensing |
| **4. Spatial Risk Assessment Dashboard** | Combine geospatial and contextual indicators (forest loss, protected-area proximity, forest type, slope, accessibility, governance indices) to identify deforestation risks. | Risk classification per polygon; Excel-based risk workbook or static PDF; spatial documentation for EUDR submissions | GIS / Remote Sensing / Forestry |
 | **5. Field Verification & Forestry Assessment** | Conduct site assessments for high-risk suppliers or ambiguous satellite results. | On-site inspection reports; forest type & degradation notes; photos, drone imagery, GPS tracks | Forestry / Field Audit |
 | **6. Monitoring & Reporting System** | Continuous monitoring for deforestation alerts and evidence-based annual reporting. | Cloud-based monitoring system (GEE, Planet NICFI); annual EUDR report; training materials & SOPs | GIS / Forestry Joint Team |

 **Important:** This service delivers spatial and environmental risk indicators derived from satellite data and open datasets. It does **not** include legal verification or legal advice.

 ## 3. Methodology Overview

 1. **Data Collection** – Supplier coordinates, boundary files, and supporting documentation.
 2. **Data Cleaning & Validation** – Coordinate accuracy, projection standardization (EPSG:4326 / UTM).
 3. **Remote Sensing Analysis** – Multi-temporal forest-loss assessment (pre/post-2020 baseline).
 4. **Spatial Risk Overlay** – Combine results with land-use designations, protected areas, slope, and governance indicators.
 5. **Verification** – On-ground or drone-based validation for uncertain cases.
 6. **Reporting & Integration** – Produce outputs compatible with the EU EUDR Information System and partner dashboards.
