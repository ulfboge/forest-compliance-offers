 # 🇸🇪 EUDR Status – Sweden Briefing (2025)

 **Competent authority:** Skogsstyrelsen (Swedish Forest Agency)

 **Last updated:** November 2025

 ---

 ## 1. Regulatory Timeline

 - **31 May 2023** – Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 adopted.
 - **29 June 2023** – Regulation entered into force.
 - **May 2025** – European Commission published country risk benchmarking (low / standard / high) – Sweden classified as **low risk** for domestic timber.
 - **30 December 2025** – Obligations apply to medium and large operators/traders.
 - **30 June 2026** – Obligations apply to micro and small enterprises.

 ## 2. Swedish Implementation Highlights

 - **Competent Authority:** Skogsstyrelsen is responsible for supervision, guidance, and enforcing EUDR compliance for timber and derived products placed on the EU market from Sweden.
 - **Coordination:** Coordination with Naturvårdsverket (Environmental Protection Agency) and Tullverket (Customs) for monitoring and customs checks.
 - **National Guidance:** Draft Swedish-language guidance focuses on combining existing forest management plans, national forest inventory data, and digital map submissions through Skogsstyrelsen’s portals.
 - **IT Systems:** Alignment underway between the EU’s central Information System and national forestry registries (Forest Data Bank / “Skogsdata”).

 ## 3. Transitional Arrangements & Exemptions

 - **Pre-December 2025 Timber:** Timber harvested before **30 December 2025** and placed on the market before that date is exempt from EUDR obligations, provided operators can demonstrate harvest date through existing felling notifications.
 - **Smallholders:** Micro and small Swedish forest owners benefit from the delayed obligation date (June 2026) but must still prepare geolocation data.
 - **Low-Risk Country Simplifications:** Operators sourcing exclusively from Swedish forests (low-risk) may apply simplified due diligence but must still submit geolocation polygons and risk assessments.

 ## 4. Data Requirements (Sweden)

 - **Production Site Definition:** “Produktionsplats” refers to the stand or compartment level polygon tied to a felling notification (avverkningsanmälan). Coordinates must represent the boundary of the harvested area, not only centroid points.
 - **Supporting Documentation:**
   - Forest management plan extract (Skogsbruksplan)
   - Harvest permit / notification ID
   - Species composition and harvested volumes
   - Proof of legal right to harvest (land registry references)
 - **Spatial Files:** GeoJSON, shapefile, or GML polygons compatible with the EU Information System; Skogsstyrelsen recommends SWEREF 99 TM (EPSG:3006) with metadata on projection.

 ## 5. Risk Considerations for Swedish Timber

 - **Deforestation Risk:** Low at national scale; focus on ensuring no conversion of key habitats or Natura 2000 areas.
 - **Biodiversity Values:** Operators must document retention forestry practices and key habitats (nyckelbiotoper) to address contextual risk factors.
 - **Cultural & Indigenous Rights:** Coordination with Sámi reindeer herding communities remains essential, especially in northern counties.

 ## 6. Opportunities for Partners

 - **OpenForests / Mergin Maps:** Offer Swedish-language, offline-capable field data capture that syncs geospatial polygons directly into due diligence packages.
 - **Preferred by Nature:** Integrate Swedish EUDR workflows into broader FSC/PEFC certification support.
 - **Komba GIS Role:** Provide spatial validation, risk overlays (protected areas, high conservation value forests), and continuous monitoring for post-harvest disturbance.
