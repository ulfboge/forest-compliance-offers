## Editing Guidelines

- Use GitHub (or Cursor) for tracked edits; each commit should describe the engagement or scenario you tailored for.
- When collaborating with non-technical partners, start in Google Docs, collect comments, and then merge changes back here for version history.
- Note major assumptions, data sources, or partner contributions in commit messages or inline comments for future reference.
- Keep references to live data or client names generic until redaction approvals are confirmed.
