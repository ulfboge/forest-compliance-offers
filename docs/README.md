Supplementary guides:

- `qgis_eudr_workflow.md` – Step-by-step field data capture workflow (QGIS + Mergin Maps).

Each Markdown document follows a shared structure:

1. **Objective** – Why the module exists and which decisions it supports.
2. **Methodology** – Step-by-step workflow, highlighting partner roles.
3. **Deliverables** – Tangible outputs shared with clients or investors.
4. **Ideal Clients & Use Cases** – Who benefits most from the module.
5. **Connection to the Integrated Assurance Platform** – How the module links with other offerings and the investment-readiness concept.

## Editing Guidelines

- Use GitHub (or Cursor) for tracked edits; each commit should describe the engagement or scenario you tailored for.
- When collaborating with non-technical partners, start in Google Docs, collect comments, and then merge changes back here for version history.
- Note major assumptions, data sources, or partner contributions in commit messages or inline comments for future reference.
- Keep references to live data or client names generic until redaction approvals are confirmed.
