# Certification Pre-Audit Screening Module

**Partners:** Komba GIS AB with accredited FSC/PEFC auditors, carbon project verifiers, and drone/field teams.

---

## Objective

Diagnose certification readiness (FSC, PEFC, carbon methodologies such as VCS) before formal audits by combining spatial evidence, document review, and partner-led site assessments. The goal is to detect issues early and resource a corrective action plan that accelerates accreditation.

---

## Methodology

1. **Intake & Standards Scoping** – Confirm target standards, management units, historical audit results, and required evidence bundles.
2. **Spatial & Documentary Review** – Apply EUDR-aligned land-use and deforestation checks, review management plans, chain-of-custody records, and community/stakeholder documentation.
3. **Gap Analysis** – Classify findings against standard-specific criteria (Compliant / Needs Attention / Critical) and prioritise remediation steps.
4. **Corrective Action Co-Design** – Facilitate workshops with client teams and partners to assign responsibilities, timelines, and monitoring checkpoints.
5. **Pre-Audit Reporting** – Produce a package for certification bodies summarising readiness level, outstanding actions, and supporting evidence.

## Deliverables

- Gap assessment matrix mapped to FSC, PEFC, or carbon standard clauses.
- Corrective action roadmap with resource estimates, sequencing, and verification requirements.
- Spatial evidence annex (maps, boundary checks, deforestation history) linked to each finding.
- Optional site verification report compiled with drone imagery and field notes.
- Pre-audit briefing pack for certification partners including contact list, timeline, and residual risks.

## Ideal Clients & Use Cases

- Forest owner associations or cooperatives preparing for certification renewal.
- Carbon project developers seeking third-party QA before validation/verification.
- Timber exporters aligning FSC/PEFC diligence with EUDR submissions.
- Impact investors benchmarking portfolio projects prior to capital deployment.
