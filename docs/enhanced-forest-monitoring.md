# Enhanced Forest Monitoring Module

**Partners:** Komba GIS AB with drone operators, telemetry integrators, and data platform providers.

---

## Objective

Provide continuous visibility into forest condition, regeneration, and disturbance signals by fusing satellite analytics with drone and in-situ measurements. This module ensures that EUDR traceability and certification commitments remain up to date between formal audits.

---

## Methodology

1. **Monitoring Framework Design** - Co-create KPIs, sampling design, cadences, and governance roles with client teams and partners.
2. **Data Integration** - Configure ingestion pipelines for satellite, drone, and telemetry sources (GEE, cloud storage, offline Mergin Maps workflows).
3. **Analytics Production** - Generate alert layers, biomass change insights, and health indices using reproducible notebooks or low-code dashboards.
4. **Operationalisation** - Deliver SOPs, training, and handover sessions; optionally retain Komba GIS AB for managed monitoring.
5. **Feedback & Escalation** - Link alerts to corrective actions, certification follow-up, or financial risk registers.

## Deliverables

- Monitoring playbook detailing KPIs, data governance, and escalation paths.
- Harmonised data model and ingestion SOP (including drone imagery standards).
- Excel or BI dashboard with near-real-time indicators and alert log.
- Training materials and governance toolkit for internal teams.
- Optional managed service agreement for quarterly analytics refresh and alert triage.

---

## Indicative Timeline

- **Design & Alignment:** 2-3 weeks to co-create KPIs, governance roles, and technology stack decisions.
- **Pilot Build:** 5-7 weeks to configure pipelines, ingest baseline data, and validate drone/telemetry integration.
- **Rollout & Training:** 3-4 weeks for full geography deployment, SOP finalisation, and handover sessions.
- **Ongoing Support (optional):** Quarterly or semi-annual refresh cycles scoped separately.

Schedules adjust based on geography, data availability, and partner coordination requirements.

## Ideal Clients & Use Cases

- Cooperatives and concession managers seeking proactive deforestation alerts.
- Carbon project developers monitoring permanence and leakage indicators.
- Certification holders maintaining compliance evidence between audit cycles.
- Impact investors requesting ongoing ESG KPI tracking for financed assets.

---

## Connection to the Integrated Assurance Platform

- **Builds on EUDR Core:** Uses traceability boundaries and risk layers as the baseline for alert monitoring.
- **Feeds Certification Module:** Supplies monitoring evidence and corrective-action proof for pre-audit reviews.
- **Supports Financial Readiness:** Provides operational KPIs (harvest progress, asset health) that flow into valuation updates.
- **Investment Verification:** Generates longitudinal datasets that third parties can use to validate impact claims.

**Disclaimer:** Monitoring accuracy depends on data availability, weather, and regulatory permissions for drone operations.
