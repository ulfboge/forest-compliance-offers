## Objective

Translate spatial compliance insights into investable plans by quantifying asset value, defining operational requirements, and mapping financing pathways for forest projects and value chains.

## Methodology

1. **Discovery & Data Audit** – Gather inventory records, production history, infrastructure status, and market assumptions; align on objectives and risk appetite.
2. **Valuation & Scenario Modeling** – Build discounted cash-flow (DCF) and carbon revenue scenarios across timber and NTFP portfolios.
3. **Operational Roadmapping** – Define machinery, workforce, logistics, and infrastructure milestones required to deliver the scenarios.
4. **Risk & Financing Strategy** – Link operational plans to ESG requirements, financing instruments, and lender expectations.
5. **Investor Narrative** – Package results into decks or memos that connect compliance evidence with financial projections.
