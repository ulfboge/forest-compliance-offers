# Operational & Financial Readiness Module

**Partners:** Komba GIS AB with financial modelers, forestry engineers, and investment advisors.

---

## Objective

Translate spatial compliance insights into investable plans by quantifying asset value, defining operational requirements, and mapping financing pathways for forest projects and value chains.

---

## Methodology

1. **Discovery & Data Audit** – Gather inventory records, production history, infrastructure status, and market assumptions; align on objectives and risk appetite.
2. **Valuation & Scenario Modeling** – Build discounted cash-flow (DCF) and (where relevant) carbon revenue scenarios across timber and NTFP portfolios, prioritising transparent models that can be maintained in Excel or other open platforms.
3. **Operational Roadmapping** – Define machinery, workforce, logistics, and infrastructure milestones required to deliver the scenarios.
4. **Risk & Financing Strategy** – Link operational plans to ESG requirements, financing instruments, and lender expectations.
5. **Investor Narrative & Tooling** – Package results into decks or memos that connect compliance evidence with financial projections, and configure user-friendly Excel workbooks or dashboards tailored to client workflows.

## Connection to the Integrated Assurance Platform

- **Consumes Monitoring Outputs:** Uses operational KPIs and alert logs to update cash-flow assumptions.
- **Depends on Certification Module:** Incorporates compliance cost estimates and corrective action budgets.
- **Extends EUDR Core:** Demonstrates how traceability risk ratings translate into financing terms and risk mitigation.
- **Investment Verification:** Packages deliverables with spatial and certification evidence for third-party reviewers.

---

## Indicative Timeline

- **Discovery & Assumption Alignment:** 2–3 weeks to consolidate data, clarify modelling objectives, and configure initial Excel templates.
- **Scenario Development:** 4–6 weeks for valuation builds, operational roadmaps, and iterative reviews with client SMEs.
- **Finalisation & Handover:** 2–4 weeks to polish narratives, stress-test models, document workflows, and train client teams.

Durations scale with the number of assets, scenarios, and stakeholder review cycles involved.
